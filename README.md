i am ali, i am a software engineer who loves everything about computers. my interests include software infrastructure, distributed systems, database internals, networks, security, interpreters, compilers and hard optimization problems.

in my free time, i spend a lot of the time on things i mentioned above + maths, stats, stocks analysis (i usually give up without any conclusive/actionable data). i also read and keep up with nyc & sf startup culture. i try to touch grass once in a while but most of the attempts are futile.

if you wanna chat about career opportunities, computers, soccer or beyblades, reach out to me on twitter @alisdotnyc or email me at ali [dot] shehbaz [at] nyu [dot] edu
