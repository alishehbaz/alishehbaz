i am ali, i am a software engineer at [at&t](https://www.att.com/) who loves everything about computers. my interests include software infrastructure, distributed systems, database internals, networks, security, interpreters, compilers and hard optimization problems.

in my free time, i spend a lot of the time on things i mentioned above + maths, stats, and financial markets. i also read and keep up with nyc & sf startup culture. i try to touch grass once in a while but most of my attempts are futile.
